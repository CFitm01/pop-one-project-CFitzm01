#It now comes to a stage where we are to iterate through the different
#combinations and come up with a stopping point.

#From the brief, it should look as follows:
#On boot it should ask you which file you wish to run the problem through.
#For now, it should also ask how many iterations you wish to do.
#For this length of iterations, it should loop throughout the program:
#-Displays a map of the current path.
#-Displays the distance of the current path.
#-Displays the best current distance.
#-While the count is less than the iteration, it should repeat this process,
#with a combination of city shift and city swap.
#Main->Read_Cities->ComputeTotalDistance->ShiftCities->SwapCities->ComputeTotal
#Distance
#etc, something along these lines.
